Hello, my name is **Jiangshan Mu**, and I received my Ph.D. in Environmental Science from the [Environment Research Institute](https://www.hj.sdu.edu.cn/), Shandong University in June 2025. I was co-advised by [Prof. Li-kun Xue](https://www.hj.sdu.edu.cn/info/1015/1532.htm) and [Prof. Yuqiang Zhang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/~f2eaAz/zh_CN/index.htm). I will begin my postdoctoral research at **Duke University (USA)** in November 2025.

My research focuses on the interactions between atmospheric composition and environmental health. I am particularly interested in:
- **Global inequalities in pollutant exposure and health impacts**
- **Atmospheric data reconstruction using machine learning**
- **Urbanization and environmental justice**

I have developed **high-resolution NOâ‚‚ datasets (2005â€“2023)** using Transformer-based models and analyzed disparities in exposure across countries and income levels. I also explore how **extreme events** such as wildfires affect atmospheric nitrogen deposition using machine learning and atmospheric models.

During my doctoral training, I participated in several field campaigns, including **high-altitude mountain observations** and **aircraft-based measurements**. From January to May 2024, I conducted collaborative research as a visiting scholar at the **Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid**, focusing on machine learning applications in extreme event attribution.

> I am deeply inspired by the pursuit of science. It is a journey of exploring the unknown, requiring persistence, curiosity, and humility. The most poetic and meaningful life I can imagine is one spent seeking truth.
