  bio: |
      My name is Mu Jiangshan. I am a doctoral candidate specializing in atmospheric environment at the Environmental Research Institute of Shandong University, under the guidance of Professors Xue Likun and Zhang Yuqiang. My primary research focus is in the domain of atmospheric photochemistry within the troposphere. To elucidate and model the intricate chemical reactions in the atmosphere, I employ a multifaceted approach, leveraging machine learning techniques, box modeling, and comprehensive field observations.

      In addition to my core research, I have a keen interest in three-dimensional modeling. I am convinced that 3D modeling can provide a more profound understanding of complex atmospheric dynamics, thereby enhancing our predictive capabilities concerning future environmental changes.

      In essence, I aspire to harness my expertise to significantly contribute to the field of atmospheric science, aiming to effect a positive change on our planet’s delicate environment.
