  bio: |
    Oscar Esteban is a Research and Teaching Ambizione FNS Fellow at the Service of
    Radiology of the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and the University of Lausanne.
    Oscar's research aims at pushing the boundaries of human and nonhuman neuroimaging
    —magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) most often,— and by that, help other researchers
    advance our understanding of the brain.
    In more specific terms, Oscar is currently developing tools that cater to researchers
    with “analysis-grade” data (see [www.nipreps.org](https://www.nipreps.org) for more on
    this concept,) so they can focus on statistical modeling and inference.
    Perhaps, the flagship of these tools is [*fMRIPrep*](https://fmriprep.org).
    Oscar actively investigates the reliability and validity of diffusion and functional MRI
    measurements.
    As a fundamental step of the neuroimaging workflow, Oscar wants to improve the computational
    reproducibility of our results and minimize this methodological variability in the preprocessing
    step by standardizing workflows and reaching consensus implementations.
    In the longer term, Oscar's vision is to contribute to uncovering the interplay of structure,
    function, and dynamics of brain connectivity using MRI.

    Céline's background is in Physics.
    In her master's, she gained plenty of experience in MRI research by
    contributing to four projects, ranging from semi-automatic segmentation of knee calcifications
    to analyzing recurrent brain co-activation patterns using clustering.
    In her PhD, she is working 
    on standardizing the quality control and the preprocessing of both structural and functional 
    MRI data.
    In particular, she is contributing to the development of easy-to-use toolboxes that automatize those processes. 
    Examples of such toolboxes are [*MRIQC*](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/) and [*fMRIPrep*](https://fmriprep.org).
    She is also interested in supporting open science and reproducibility of MRI research.
    Her further goal is to determine the optimal preprocessing flow by performing tests on one densely-acquired patient. 
    This will enable to focus on the methodological variability by removing inter-subject variability.
    On a third step, 
    she will engage in bridging structure and function into a single framework and apply the methodology 
    developed to the study of the integrative role of the Thalamus.

    My background is in Astrophysics. During my PhD, I developed deep-learning tools to classify, segment and generate images.
    In addition to a machine learning core, my PhD research involved a substantial amount of image processing.
    In The AxonLab, I contribute to implementing preprocessing tools under the umbrella of the [*NiPreps* ecosystem](https://nipreps.org) to improve computational reproducibility and reduce methodological variability in MRI research.
    In addition to this, I am strongly committed to promoting open science.
