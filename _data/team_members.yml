  bio: |
    Oscar Esteban is a Research and Teaching Ambizione FNS Fellow at the Service of
    Radiology of the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and the University of Lausanne.
    Oscar's research aims at pushing the boundaries of human and nonhuman neuroimaging
    —magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) most often,— and by that, help other researchers
    advance our understanding of the brain.
    In more specific terms, Oscar is currently developing tools that cater to researchers
    with “analysis-grade” data (see [www.nipreps.org](https://www.nipreps.org) for more on
    this concept,) so they can focus on statistical modeling and inference.
    Perhaps, the flagship of these tools is [*fMRIPrep*](https://fmriprep.org).
    Oscar actively investigates the reliability and validity of diffusion and functional MRI
    measurements.
    As a fundamental step of the neuroimaging workflow, Oscar wants to improve the computational
    reproducibility of our results and minimize this methodological variability in the preprocessing
    step by standardizing workflows and reaching consensus implementations.
    In the longer term, Oscar's vision is to contribute to uncovering the interplay of structure,
    function, and dynamics of brain connectivity using MRI.
