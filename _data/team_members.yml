  bio: |
      My name is Mu Jiangshan. I am Ph.D. specializing in Atmospheric Environment at the Environmental Research Institute, Shandong University, under the supervision of Professors Li-kun Xue and Yuqiang Zhang. My research centers on atmospheric photochemistry in the troposphere, with a particular focus on unraveling and modeling complex chemical processes. To this end, I integrate machine learning, box modeling, and comprehensive field observations to advance our understanding of atmospheric chemical mechanisms.  
      
      Beyond my core research, I am deeply interested in three-dimensional atmospheric modeling. I believe that 3D modeling offers a powerful lens through which to explore and interpret the dynamic behavior of the atmosphere, ultimately improving our capacity to predict and respond to environmental changes.
      
      At the heart of my scientific pursuit is a commitment to leveraging interdisciplinary tools and insights to address pressing environmental challenges. I aspire to contribute meaningfully to atmospheric science and to help safeguard the Earth's fragile environment through rigorous, impactful research.
