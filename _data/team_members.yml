  bio: |
    Hello, my name is Mu Jiangshan and I am currently a PhD candidate in the field of atmospheric environment, and I am currently studying at the Environmental Research Institute of Shandong University, supervised by Professor Xue Likun and Professor Zhang Yuqiang.>
    My main area of research is atmospheric photochemistry in the troposphere. I utilize various methods, including machine learning, box modeling, and field observations, to investigate and model complex chemical reactions in the atmosphere.>
    In addition to my research on atmospheric chemistry, I am also very interested in 3D modeling. I believe that 3D modeling can help us better understand complex atmospheric processes and improve our ability to predict future changes in the environment.>
    Overall, my goal is to use my skills and knowledge to contribute to the field of atmospheric science and to make a positive impact on our planet's environment.
