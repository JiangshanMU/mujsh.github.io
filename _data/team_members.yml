  bio: |
      My name is Mu Jiangshan, and I am a doctoral candidate specializing in atmospheric environment at the Environmental Research Institute of Shandong University. I have the privilege of being mentored by Professors Xue Likun and Zhang Yuqiang.<br>
      
      My primary research focus lies in the domain of atmospheric photochemistry within the troposphere. To elucidate and model the intricate chemical reactions in the atmosphere, I employ a multifaceted approach, leveraging machine learning techniques, box modeling, and comprehensive field observations.<br>
      
      In addition to my core research, I harbor a keen interest in three-dimensional modeling. I am convinced that 3D modeling can provide a more profound comprehension of intricate atmospheric dynamics, thereby enhancing our predictive capabilities concerning future environmental shifts.<br>
     
      In essence, I aspire to harness my expertise to significantly contribute to the realm of atmospheric science, aiming to effect a positive change on our planet's delicate environment.
