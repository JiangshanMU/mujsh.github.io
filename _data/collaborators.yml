  bio: |
    My PhD research used MRI to identify changes in brain networks related to healthy ageing.
    During this time, I realised my enthusiasm for solving data analysis problems and developing resources
    for image processing and analysis.
    In particular, I am interested in extending processing tools developed for human data to be species
    agnostic, and supporting open science and reproducibility in the preclinical MRI community.
    I continue to apply network-based analysis methods to MRI data with the aim of modelling brain changes over time.
